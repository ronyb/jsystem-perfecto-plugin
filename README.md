This repository consists of the following Java Maven projects:
* ***perfecto-mobile-browser*** - A standalone Java application, implementing a web browser which allows interacting with Perfecto Mobile's "Mobile Cloud" web application views - "Perfecto Lab" and "Perfecto Dashboard". The application also receives the  generated **executionId** after logging-in to the Perfecto app, stores it in memorey and serves it to other applications via a TCP socket.
* ***jsystem-perfecto-plugin*** - Adding this plugin to JSystem allows adding Perfecto Mobile's tab inside the JSystem runner GUI. The plugin allows to configure the Perfecto cloud properties (host, username, password), and launching the **perfecto-mobile-browser** application.
* ***jsystem-perfecto-infra*** - A JSystem SO project, containing the needed dependencies and classes for interacting with the Perfecto cloud and with the **perfecto-mobile-browser** application, to read the current **executionId**.
* ***jsystem-perfecto-tests*** - A sample JSystem-Perfecto tests project. The project depends on the **jsystem-perfecto-infra** project, and contains the `JSystemPerfectoTest` class, responsible for intializing the communication with the Perfecto cloud.

###Description and use

This is a standalone Java GUI application, based on the [SWT library](https://www.eclipse.org/swt/). The application can be used on its own, or it could be launched from Perfecto's tab inside JSystem runner.

To launch the application, double click on the `perfecto-mobile-browser-<version>.jar` file, or launch it from the command line by typing: `java -jar perfecto-mobile-browser-<version>.jar`.

When launching the application without providing command line arguments, two browser windows are opened: "Perfecto Lab" and "Perfecto Dashboard" - each opens a different URL on the Perfecto Mobile Cloud.

It is possible to launch just one browser - "Perfecto Lab" or "Perfecto Dashboard" by adding a single command line argument:

For "Perfecto Lab": `java -jar perfecto-mobile-browser-<version>.jar lab`<br/>
For "Perfecto Dashboard": `java -jar perfecto-mobile-browser-<version>.jar dashboard`

####perfecto.properties
The application depends on the `perfecto.properties` file which should be located inside the same directory as the JAR file.
The `perfecto.properties` file is used to configure the URL of the Perfecto Cloud and the username and password which would be used by the application to perform automatic log-in inside the web page, by invoking the `doExternalLogin` JavaScript function on the client-side.

####Reading the executionId
The core feature of the application is to communicate with the client-side JavaScript code of the Perfecto application. The application receives and stores the **executionId** that's created after logging-in to "Perfecto Lab". The executionId is stored in memory, and can later be queried by other applications, e.g., code running from a JSystem test.

When launched, the application runs a TCP server, listening on port 3456. The server supprts the following requests from clients:<br>
`getExecutionId` - returns the current executionId<br>
`getHost` - returns the the current Perfeco cloud host, as was configured in the `perfecto.properties` file<br>

###How to build and deploy
This is a Maven project. To build it, run the following command line: `mvn clean install` from the project root directory.
